make sure to add the following to package.json: yarn add react-native-reanimated and
yarn add react-native-gesture-handler.

Then do the following steps

1-import "react-native-gesture-handler";
to App.tsx
2- npx expo start -c



Some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo version:
  react-native-gesture-handler@2.13.4 - expected version: ~2.12.0
  react-native-reanimated@3.5.4 - expected version: ~3.3.0
Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.
Fix with: npx expo install --fix
